# CHAPAS
For the Cambridge study 
Folder arrangement:
1. Core scripts: these are the original core scripts that we had. We dont need to use these other than as for reference. 
2. Matlab functions: these are important in generating the graphs. Must be added to path prior to going through scripts in next point below. 
3. Modified CHAPAS scripts. THese will be the scripts that Youssuf is developing specifically for the dataset being provided. It includes questionnaire specific elements as well as a modification of the analysis to suit the questionnaire correlations. 
4. Processed matfiles: These are saved files with all the variables generated after pre-processing. The first includes the 33 patients, the second excludes the two last patients and hence is titled 'CHAPAS33ex2'.
